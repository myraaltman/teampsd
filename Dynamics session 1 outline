## Session: Dynamics, Session 1
 
### Key Idea Icon

* Employees are willing to perform and provide quality work, but their success is
directly tied to and limited by the nature of the system they are working in
(band v. bowling team).
* Quality improvement strategies and provider morale are closely linked.
Previously used QI strategies and data may not feel valid or useful because they
do not address the fundamental dynamics at play in the system and can be used
to punish or reward, which can lead to policy resistance.  
* PSD is a system that takes a totally contrasting approach where frontline staff
are directly engaged in a colearning process that understands tradeoffs in the
system (e.g., outcomes and burnout) and maximizes the functioning of the whole
system. 

### Definitions- Book Icon

* Dynamic hypothesis  
* Trade Off
* General Quality Improvement Capacity
* EBP Specific Capacity

### Dialogue- Hexagon Icon

* Illustrative Exercise: The difference between being on a bowling team and in a band. 

### Learning Loop (Practice/ Exercise)

* Initiating and elaborating a causal loop diagram. Developing a dynamic
hypothesis for “limited EBP reach”   

### Hexagon Molecule (Lesson Overview) "Putting it Together"

* The greater the interdependence of the system, the greater the need for learning and
coordination. In order to model to learn, we need participating, eliciting
mental models, making mental models explicit 
* The data used in this approach emerge out of the interactions of the whole system. Want stakeholders
to see the whole system behavior and its parts in new ways. Want them to be
able to zoom in and zoom out.
